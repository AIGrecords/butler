# OBJECTIVES

- Make Butler easy to use and less time consuming for the developer
- Allow the user to select a specific set of functions when making a request for the package in order to avoid bloated projects
- Enhance browser loading time by a significant amount
- Pay attention to detail, We should be patient and pay close attention to every line that's written...
- Each person should focus on their specialty(currently box-shadow & transiton for me) and give it their all and also present it in a manner that's **extremely verbose**...
- Remember, we are not here to deobfuscate each other's code
